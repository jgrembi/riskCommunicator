\arguments{
\item{data}{(Required) A data.frame containing variables for
\code{Y}, \code{X}, and \code{Z} or with variables matching the model
variables specified in a user-supplied formula. Data set should also
contain variables for the optional \code{subgroup} and \code{offset}, if
they are specified.}

\item{outcome.type}{(Required) Character argument to describe the outcome
type. Acceptable responses, and the corresponding error distribution and
link function used in the \code{glm}, include: \describe{
\item{binary}{(Default) A binomial distribution with link = 'logit' is
used.} 
\item{count}{A Poisson distribution with link = 'log' is used.}
\item{count_nb}{A negative binomial model with link = 'log' is used, where the theta 
parameter is estimated internally; ideal for over-dispersed count data.}
\item{rate}{A Poisson distribution with link = 'log' is used; ideal for 
 events/person-time outcomes.} 
 \item{rate_nb}{A negative binomial model with link = 'log' is used, where the theta 
parameter is estimated internally; ideal for over-dispersed events/person-time outcomes.}
 \item{continuous}{A gaussian distribution with link = 'identity' is used.}
}}

\item{formula}{(Optional) Default NULL. An object of class "formula" (or one
that can be coerced to that class) which provides the the complete model
formula, similar to the formula for the glm function in R (e.g. `Y ~ X + Z1
+ Z2 + Z3`). Can be supplied as a character or formula object. If no
formula is provided, Y and X must be provided.}

\item{Y}{(Optional) Default NULL. Character argument which specifies the
outcome variable. Can optionally provide a formula instead of \code{Y} and
\code{X} variables.}

\item{X}{(Optional) Default NULL. Character argument which specifies the
exposure variable (or treatment group assignment), which can be binary,
categorical, or continuous. This variable can be supplied as a factor
variable (for binary or categorical exposures) or a continuous variable.
For binary/categorical exposures, \code{X} should be supplied as a factor 
with the lowest level set to the desired referent. Numeric variables are 
accepted, but will be centered (see Note). Character variables are not 
accepted and will throw an error. Can optionally provide a formula
instead of \code{Y} and \code{X} variables.}

\item{Z}{(Optional) Default NULL. List or single character vector which
specifies the names of covariates or other variables to adjust for in the
\code{glm} function. All variables should either be factors, continuous, 
or coded 0/1 (i.e. not character variables). Does not allow interaction terms.}

\item{subgroup}{(Optional) Default NULL. Character argument that indicates
subgroups for stratified analysis. Effects will be reported for each
category of the subgroup variable. Variable will be automatically converted
to a factor if not already.}

\item{offset}{(Optional, only applicable for rate/count outcomes) Default NULL.
Character argument which specifies the variable name to be used as the 
person-time denominator for rate outcomes to be included as an offset in the
Poisson regression model. Numeric variable should be on the linear scale; 
function will take natural log before including in the model.}

\item{rate.multiplier}{(Optional, only applicable for rate/count outcomes). 
Default 1. Numeric variable signifying the person-time value to use in 
predictions; the offset variable will be set to this when predicting under 
the counterfactual conditions. This value should be set to the person-time 
denominator desired for the rate difference measure and must be inputted in 
the units of the original offset variable (e.g. if the offset variable is 
in days and the desired rate difference is the rate per 100 person-years, 
rate.multiplier should be inputted as 365.25*100).}

\item{exposure.scalar}{(Optional, only applicable for continuous exposure)
Default 1. Numeric value to scale effects with a continuous exposure. This 
option facilitates reporting effects for an interpretable contrast (i.e. 
magnitude of difference) within the continuous exposure. For example, if 
the continuous exposure is age in years, a multiplier of 10 would result 
in estimates per 10-year increase in age rather than per a 1-year increase 
in age.}

\item{R}{(Optional) Default 200. The number of data resamples to be conducted
to produce the bootstrap confidence interval of the estimate.}

\item{clusterID}{(Optional) Default NULL. Character argument which specifies
the variable name for the unique identifier for clusters. This option
specifies that clustering should be accounted for in the calculation of
confidence intervals. The \code{clusterID} will be used as the level for
resampling in the bootstrap procedure.}

\item{parallel}{(Optional) Default "no." The type of parallel operation to be used. Available 
options (besides the default of no parallel processing) include "multicore" (not available 
for Windows) or "snow." This argument is passed directly to \code{\link[boot]{boot}}.
See note below about setting seeds and parallel computing.}

\item{ncpus}{(Optional, only used if parallel is set to "multicore" or "snow") Default 1. 
Integer argument for the number of CPUs available for parallel processing/ number of 
parallel operations to be used.  This argument is passed directly to \code{\link[boot]{boot}}}
}

  limits of the outcome difference and ratio (in a print-pretty format)}

  \item{$R}{Number of bootstrap iterations}
  \item{$boot.result}{Data.frame containing the results of the \code{R}
  bootstrap iterations of the g-computation} 
  \item{$contrast}{Contrast levels compared} 
  \item{$family}{Error distribution used in the model}
  \item{$formula}{Model formula used to fit the \code{glm}}
  \item{$predicted.outcome}{A data.frame with the marginal mean predicted outcomes

  fitted regression of the outcome on the exposure and relevant covariates.}
}
\description{
Obtain a point estimate and 95\% confidence interval for
  difference and ratio effects comparing exposed and unexposed (or treatment and non-treatment)
  groups using g-computation.
}
\details{
The \code{gComp} function executes the following steps: 
\enumerate{
  \item Calls the \code{\link{pointEstimate}} function on the data to obtain
  the appropriate effect estimates (difference, ratio, etc.). 
  \item Generates \code{R} bootstrap resamples of the data, with replacement. If
  the resampling is to be done at the cluster level (set using the
  \code{clusterID} argument), the number of clusters will remain constant but
  the total number of observations in each resampled data set might be
  different if clusters are not balanced. 
  \item Calls the \code{\link{pointEstimate}} function on each of the resampled data sets.
  \item Calculates the 95\% confidence interval of the difference and ratio
  estimates using the results obtained from the \code{R} resampled parameter
  estimates. }   
  
  As bootstrap resamples are generated with random sampling, users should
  set a seed (\code{\link{set.seed}} for reproducible
  confidence intervals.
  
  While offsets are used to account for differences in follow-up time 
  between individuals in the \code{glm} model, rate differences are 
  calculated assuming equivalent follow-up of all individuals (i.e. 
  predictions for each exposure are based on all observations having the 
  same offset value). The default is 1 (specifying 1 unit of the original 
  offset variable) or the user can specify an offset to be used in the 
  predictions with the rate.multiplier argument.
}
\note{
Note that for a protective exposure (risk difference less than 0), the 
  'Number needed to treat/harm' is interpreted as the number needed to treat, 
  and for a harmful exposure (risk difference greater than 0), it is 
  interpreted as the number needed to harm. Note also that confidence intervals 
  are not reported for the number needed to treat/harm. If the confidence 
  interval (CI) for the risk difference crosses the null, the construction of 
  the CI for the number needed to treat/harm is not well defined. Challenges 
  and options for reporting the number needed to treat/harm CI are reviewed 
  extensively in Altman 1998, Hutton 2000, and Stang 2010, with a consensus 
  that an appropriate interval would have two segments, one bounded at negative 
  infinity and the other at positive infinity. Because the number needed to 
  treat/harm is most useful as a communication tool and is directly derived 
  from the risk difference, which has a CI that provides a more interpretable 
  measure of precision, we do not report the CI for the number needed to 
  treat/harm. If the CI of the risk difference does not cross the null, the 
  number needed to treat/harm CI can be calculated straightforwardly by 
  taking the inverse of each confidence bound of the risk difference.

For continuous exposure variables, the default effects are provided 
  for a one unit difference in the exposure at the mean value of the exposure 
  variable. Because the underlying parametric model for a binary outcome is 
  logistic regression, the risks for a continuous exposure will be estimated 
  to be linear on the log-odds (logit) scale, such that the odds ratio for 
  any one unit increase in the continuous variable is constant. However, 
  the risks will not be linear on the linear (risk difference) or log (risk 
  ratio) scales, such that these parameters will not be constant across the 
  range of the continuous exposure. Users should be aware that the risk 
  difference, risk ratio, number needed to treat/harm (for a binary outcome) 
  and the incidence rate difference (for a rate/count outcome) reported with 
  a continuous exposure apply specifically at the mean of the continuous 
  exposure. The effects do not necessarily apply across the entire range of 
  the variable. However, variations in the effect are likely small, 
  especially near the mean.

The documentation for \code{\link[boot]{boot}} includes details about 
 reproducible seeds when using parallel computing.
