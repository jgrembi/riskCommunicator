\title{Print estimates of difference and ratio effects obtained in the bootstrap
computations of the g-computation}
\usage{
\method{print}{gComp}(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{(Required) An object of class \code{gComp}.}

\item{...}{(Optional) Further arguments passed to or from other methods.}
}
\value{
The resulting point estimate and 95% confidence intervals of the
  difference and ratio.
}
\description{
Print results from bootstrap computations of the g-computation
}
\examples{
## Obtain the risk difference and risk ratio for cardiovascular disease or 
## death between patients with and without diabetes, while controlling for
## age, sex, BMI, whether the individual is currently a smoker, and 
## if they have a history of hypertension.
