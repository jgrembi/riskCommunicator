Description: \code{riskCommunicator} is a package for estimating flexible epidemiological effect measures including both differences and ratios. The package is based on the parametric G-formula developed by Robbins et. al. in 1986 as an alternative to inverse probabilty weighting.  It is useful for estimating the impact of interventions in the presence of treatment-confounder-feedback and is a powerful tool for causal inference, but has seen limited success due to lack of software for the computationally intensive components.
