Description: Estimates flexible epidemiological effect measures including both differences and ratios using the parametric G-formula developed as an alternative to inverse probability weighting.  It is useful for estimating the impact of interventions in the presence of treatment-confounder-feedback. G-computation was originally described by Robbins (1986) <doi:10.1016/0270-0255(86)90088-6> and has been described in detail by Ahern, Hubbard, and Galea (2009) <doi:10.1093/aje/kwp015>; Snowden, Rose, and Mortimer (2011) <doi:10.1093/aje/kwq472>; and Westreich et al. (2012) <doi:10.1002/sim.5316>.
