#' The \code{framingham} data set
#'
#' The Framingham Heart Study is a long term prospective study of the etiology of 
#' cardiovascular disease among a population of free living subjects in the community of Framingham, Massachusetts. The Framingham 
#' Heart Study was a landmark study in epidemiology in that it was the first prospective study of cardiovascular disease and 
#' identified the concept of risk factors and their joint effects. The study began in 1948 and 5,209 subjects were initially 
#' enrolled in the study. Participants have been examined biennially since the inception of the study and all subjects are 
#' continuously followed through regular surveillance for cardiovascular outcomes. Clinic examination data has included 
#' cardiovascular disease risk factors and markers of disease such as blood pressure, blood chemistry, lung function, smoking 
#' history, health behaviors, ECG tracings, Echocardiography, and medication use. Through regular surveillance of area hospitals,
#' participant contact, and death certificates, the Framingham Heart Study reviews and adjudicates events for the occurrence of 
#' Angina Pectoris, Myocardial Infarction, Heart Failure, and Cerebrovascular disease.
#' The enclosed dataset is a subset of the data collected as part of the Framingham study and includes laboratory, clinic, 
#' questionnaire, and adjudicated event data on 4,434 participants. Participant clinic data was collected during three examination 
#' periods, approximately 6 years apart, from roughly 1956 to 1968. Each participant was followed for a total of 24 years for the 
#' outcome of the following events: Angina Pectoris, Myocardial Infarction, Atherothrombotic Infarction or Cerebral Hemorrhage 
#' (Stroke) or death.
