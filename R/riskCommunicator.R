#' riskCommunicator: Obtaining interpretable epidemiological effect
#' estimates
#'
#' \code{riskCommunicator} is a package for estimating flexible epidemiological
#' effect measures including both differences and ratios. The package is based
#' on the parametric G-formula developed by Robbins et. al. in 1986 as an
#' alternative to inverse probabilty weighting.  It is useful for estimating the
#' impact of interventions in the presence of treatment-confounder-feedback and
#' is a powerful tool for causal inference, but has seen limited success due to
#' lack of software for the computationally intensive components. This package
#' provides three main functions.  The first, \code{pointEstimate}, obtains a
#' point estimate of the difference and ratio effect estimates. This function is
#' typically called within the \code{gComp} function, but is available for use
#' in special cases for example when the user requires more explicit control
#' over bootstrap resampling (e.g. nested clusters). The second function,
#' \code{gComp}, is the workhorse function that obtains point estimates for
#' difference and ratio effects along with their 95/% confidence intervals. The
#' \code{plot} function allows users to visualize the bootstrap results. We
#' provide the \code{framingham} dataset, which is the teaching dataset from the
#' Framingham Heart Study, as well as a subset of that data, \code{cvdd} for
#' users.
